SUMMARY
=========

Over CodetheCity8 weekend team ALISS focused on three use cases, focused on one of those, documented the User Experience of the human / chatbot interaction.  Based upon the first use case, a template chatbot was selected, UI and Voice, a fixed or rigid set of rules/logic was coded to produce the workflow and finally data was retrieved from the ALISS data API based upon keyword and location.  This produced a lot of learning and basis to free up the chatbot to many use cases.

GOING FORWARD
==============

Updated outstanding UI updates and logic workflows listed in GITHUB issues.

FREEing up the chatbot.

1. Review use experience again, start, interaction, stop etc.
2. Need to extract text / interaction from human and process in own javascript class
3. Extract logic / workflow i.e. the AI engine for the bot to its own class.
4. Extract out UI / html / css building code e.g. for yes no  insert map widget etc.
5. Extract preparing data from ALISS rest api,  probably requires a CHATBOT rest API upgrade to save time in clients browser.
6. Think more about blind, deaf, disability interaction with chatbot.
